Problem Scenario

Title: Optimising Voucher Discounts at a Modern Supermarket Checkout
In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, a well-known urban supermarket chain, CityMart, has embraced digital transformation by enabling customers to use digital vouchers at self-checkout kiosks and mobile app-assisted counters. These vouchers offer targeted discounts such as RM5 off with a minimum spend on bakery items or 10% off selected dairy products but they come with strict usage conditions and limitations on combinations.

Customers often collect multiple vouchers, but not all vouchers can be used together due to conflicting rules or restrictions. This makes it difficult for customers to know which vouchers to apply for the biggest savings.

At checkout, many customers try vouchers one at a time, which leads to missed discounts and frustration. Meanwhile, the supermarket sometimes loses revenue because vouchers are misused or applied incorrectly. The slow, manual process also causes longer wait times and a poor shopping experience.

This situation is causing customer dissatisfaction and lost revenue, a serious challenge for CityMart. The goal is to develop an efficient system that automatically finds the best combination of valid vouchers for each shopping cart, ensuring customers get the maximum savings while protecting the store’s profit
